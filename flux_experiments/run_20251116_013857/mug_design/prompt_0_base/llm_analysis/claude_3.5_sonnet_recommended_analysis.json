  "prompt": "transform logo into festive holiday mug design with snowflakes",
  "analysis": "Here's my analysis of the mug design transformation:\n\n### 1. Prompt Adherence \u2713\n- Successfully added festive elements (red snowflakes)\n- Maintained geometric logo while adding holiday theme\n- Good balance between original design and seasonal elements\n\n### 2. Logo Preservation \u2713\n- Hexagonal geometric pattern fully preserved\n- Blue-to-purple gradient maintained from original\n- Clean, crisp edges on geometric elements\n\n### 3. Design Quality \u2713\n- High merchandise viability\n- Good contrast with white mug background\n- Professional spacing of elements\n- Snowflakes well-distributed around main design\n\n### 4. Word Attribution Insights\nStrong Impact:\n- \"Snowflakes\" - Created clear red decorative elements\n- \"Transform\" - Maintained logo integrity while adapting\n- \"Festive\" - Influenced color choices and overall mood\n\nMinimal Impact:\n- \"Holiday\" showed least difference in heatmap\n- Could remove \"holiday\" as \"festive\" carries similar intent\n\n### 5. Prompt Improvements\n1. \"Create geometric winter mug design with crystalline snowflakes around [logo]\"\n   - WHY: More specific about geometric style matching\n\n2. \"Transform logo into frosted winter design with radial snowflake pattern\"\n   - WHY: Better control over snowflake placement\n\n3. \"Adapt logo for mug with minimal sacred geometry and delicate frost elements\"\n   - WHY: Preserves geometric nature while adding winter elements\n\nThe attribution maps show \"snowflakes\" and \"transform\" were most influential, so focusing on geometric and winter-specific terms would likely yield better results.",
